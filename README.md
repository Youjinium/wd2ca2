Welcome! I am [Youjinium] and this is my GitHub repository containing the piano sheet for the song "Yui-no-Ketsui" with their respective code I have written in [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/).

Lilypond in short is the equivalent to [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) but for writing music scores.
